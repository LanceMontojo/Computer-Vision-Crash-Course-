I'm writing to explain a mistake with my submission for Activity 7. I accidentally submitted an older, incomplete version because I forgot to save my final work yesterday. I have now submitted the correct, finished version, and I hope that the documentation provided will offer sufficient proof that I completed the assignment, including the implementation of the different face recognition algorithms, before the deadline.
