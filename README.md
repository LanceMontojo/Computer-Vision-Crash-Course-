## Introduction
<p align="left">
My name is Lance Marciano Montojo. I am now a 3rd-year data science student at Technological Institute of the Philippines (T.I.P) in Quezon City.

These IPYNB 🗒 notebooks are part of my studies in the course 💻CPE 313 - Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning💻, along with files related to these notebooks.
</p>

In each activities, I gathered knowledge like:

🤗 Image Representation & Transformation – I learned how to manipulate and convert images using OpenCV, inspect image properties, and extract regions of interest for feature analysis.

📏 Edge & Contour Detection – I applied Canny edge detection and contour detection to highlight object boundaries, improving image analysis and object recognition.

🫶 Shape Recognition – I used Hough Transform techniques to detect lines and circles, emphasizing the role of parameter tuning in improving detection accuracy.

😯 Face Recognition & Preprocessing – I explored face recognition by testing different algorithms, highlighting the importance of dataset preparation and preprocessing for better accuracy.

📹 Video Processing – I successfully captured, displayed, and saved video files using OpenCV, understanding how to configure video capture and implement user interactions.

👀 Face & Eye Detection 😀 – I implemented real-time face and eye detection using Haar cascades, reinforcing how trained models and parameter adjustments improve feature detection.
