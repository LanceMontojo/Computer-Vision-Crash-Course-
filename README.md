## Summary of Learnings
<p align="left">
Through these activities, I explored fundamental image processing techniques using OpenCV, including image representation, transformation, and feature extraction. I applied edge detection, contour detection, and shape recognition to analyze objects, demonstrating the importance of parameter tuning for accurate results. Additionally, I worked with video processing and face detection, reinforcing how dataset quality, model selection, and preprocessing impact recognition accuracy in computer vision applications.
